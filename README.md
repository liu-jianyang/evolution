This is a game of betting. Monsters fight in an arena, overwatched by a judge, 
or more, with spectators betting on who will win. However, the spectators are
all mages, and thus each believe that s/he can influence the arena to some 
degree, to ensure that the monsters they bet on will win. There are a variety
of ways for them to do so, from small things as enchanting the ground to be 
more slippery to increasing one of the monsters' strength, to causing a volcano 
to explode. However, the bigger the effect, the more likely the judge(s) will 
take notice, though at their discretion they may choose to do nothing at all, 
or they may reverse all enchantments on a monster.
